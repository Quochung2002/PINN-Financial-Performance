This repository represents the research work we have done in redesigning traditional neural networks into Physics-Informed neural networks (PINNs) and applying these systems in the financial engineering field. Some of our contributions consist of:

- Utilizing Newton's laws and Navier-Stokes Fluid Dynamic Theory to calculate the Physics Loss of the training process
- Experimenting the redesigned PINNs with 3 10-asset portfolios from three different financial markets: USA, Vietnam, and China.
- Construct a new PINNs structure called Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to decompose multivariate functions into sums of learnable univariate functions (B-splines).
